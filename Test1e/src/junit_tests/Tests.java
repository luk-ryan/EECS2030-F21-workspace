/*
 * Problem:
 * 
 * - You are required to implement a small system for managing student records.
 * 
 * - Each student record is characterized by the tile of a course they are taking (e.g., "EECS2030") 
 * 		and a (possibly empty) array of assessments. 
 * 	 
 *   We assume that the maximum number of assessments of each student record is 10.
 * 
 * - Each assessment is characterized by: 
 * 		+ its name (e.g., Midterm 1)
 * 		+ its weight of the course final grade (e.g., 0.15234 which means 15.234 percents)
		+ marks that the student receives for that assessment (e.g., 65) 
 * 		
 *   For simplicity, we assume that the maximum marks for each assignment is 100. 
 *   Marks of an assessment may be changed.
 * 
 * - Given a student record, we may:
 * 		+ Add a new assessment.
 * 		+ Delete an assessment whose name matches the input string.
 * 			You can assume that all added assessments contain no duplicates of names. 
 * 			(meaning that if the input name is an existing name of assessment, 
 * 				there is only one â€œslotâ€� in the array of assessments to be â€œremovedâ€�).
 *  
 * 			If a non-existing name of assessment is given, then do nothing without modifying anything.
 * 		+ Change the marks of an assessment identified by some name (if that name exists). 
 * 			If a non-existing name of assessment is given, then change nothing.
 * 		+ Return a report of the assessments so far.
 * 		+ Return the rate of completion of so far.
 * 		+ Return the raw marks so far.
 * 
 * - As an example, say in the student record of HeeYeon for her EECS2030, 
 * 		there are two assessments so far:
 * 			1. Midterm 1 (weighting 15% of the course), for which she receives 75 marks
 * 			2. Lab Test 1 (weighting 20% of the course), for which she receives 60 marks
 * 	 
 *   Then HeeYeonâ€™s completion rate so far is 15% + 20% = 35% (i.e., 0.35), 
 *   	and her raw marks so far are: 75 * 0.15 + 60 * 0.2 = 23.25

	 * 1. Do NOT create any new packages. 
	 * 		All classes you create must be in the `model` package.

	 * 2. All attributes you declare in the classes must be *** private ***.
	 * 
	 * 3. You are free to create additional private or public helper methods.
	 * 
	 * 4. You must NOT create any class not indicated by the given JUnit tests.
	 * 
	 * 5. You must NOT put any System.out.print statements in the classes you create.
	 * 
	 * 6. Programming Requirements:
	 * 	- You are only allowed to use primitive arrays (e.g., int[], String[], Facility[]) 
	 * 		for declaring attributes and implementing methods.
	 * 	- Any use of a Java library class or method is forbidden 
	 * 		(that is, use selections and loops to build your solution from scratch instead):
	 * 	- Here are some examples of forbidden classes/methods: 
	 * 		- Arrays class (e.g., Arrays.copyOf)
	 * 		- System class (e.g., System.arrayCopy)
	 * 		- ArrayList class
	 * 		- String class (e.g., substring).
	 * 	- The use of some library classes does not require an import statement, 
	 * 		but these classes are also forbidden to be used.
	 * 	- Here are the exceptions (library methods which you are allowed to use if needed):
	 * 		- String class (equals, format)
	 * 
	 * You will receive a penalty as specified on the test guide if this requirement is violated.

	/*
	 * Your expected workflow should be:
	 * 
	 * Step 1: Eliminate compilation errors. 
	 * 	Declare all the required classes and methods (returning default values if necessary), 
	 * 	so that the project contains no compilation errors (i.e., no red crosses shown on the Eclipse editor).
	 * 
	 * Step 2: Pass all unit tests. Add private attributes and complete the method implementations accordingly, 
	 * 	so that executing all tests result in a green bar.
	 * 
	 * If necessary, you are free to declare (private or public) helper methods.
	 * 
	 * Any new classes that are ***not*** indicated by the given JUnit tests will be ***disregarded*** in grading.
