	 * 1. Do NOT create any new packages. 
	 * 		All classes you create must be in the `model` package.
	 * 
	 * 2. All attributes you declare in the classes must be *** private *** or ***protected***.
	 * 
	 * 3. You are free to create additional private, protected, or public helper methods.
	 * 
	 * 4. You must NOT create any class not indicated by the given JUnit tests.
	 * 
	 * 5. You must NOT put any System.out.print statements in the classes you create.
	 * 
	 * 6. Programming Requirements:
	 * 	- You are only allowed to use primitive arrays (e.g., int[], String[], Facility[]) 
	 * 		for declaring attributes and implementing methods.
	 * 	- Any use of a Java library class or method is forbidden 
	 * 		(that is, use selections and loops to build your solution from scratch instead):
	 * 	- Here are some examples of forbidden classes/methods: 
	 * 		- Arrays class (e.g., Arrays.copyOf)
	 * 		- System class (e.g., System.arrayCopy)
	 * 		- ArrayList class
	 * 		- String class (e.g., substring).
	 * 	- The use of some library classes does not require an import statement, 
	 * 		but these classes are also forbidden to be used.
	 * 	- Here are the exceptions (library methods which you are allowed to use if needed):
	 * 		- String class (equals, format)
	 * 
	 * You will receive a penalty as specified on the test guide if this requirement is violated.
	 */
	
	/*
	 * Your expected workflow should be:
	 * 
	 * Step 1: Eliminate compilation errors. 
	 * 	Declare all the required classes and methods (returning default values if necessary), 
	 * 	so that the project contains no compilation errors (i.e., no red crosses shown on the Eclipse editor).
	 * 
	 * Step 2: Pass all unit tests. Add private or protected attributes and complete the method implementations accordingly, 
	 * 	so that executing all tests result in a green bar.
	 * 
	 * If necessary, you are free to declare (private, protected, or public) helper methods.
	 * 
	 * Any new classes that are ***not*** indicated by the given JUnit tests will be ***disregarded*** in grading.
